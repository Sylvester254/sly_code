# Progressive Web Apps
> This is a type of web application that's converted to work as a standard mobile application that can be installed on multiple platforms.
###
- In simple terms, they are basically websites styled like apps that can be run either inside a website browser or installed directly on a mobile device and accessed like a native app. 
- A PWA is built with HTML, CSS and Javascript.
## There are three key components of a PWA:

 -   Service Worker: The service worker transforms the website into an app by allowing it to download and cache files on a device.
 -  Web Manifest: This JSON file provides the basic meta-information about the app, such as the app icon, background color, etc.
 -  Secure HTTPS: HTTPS is mandatory and makes PWAs more secure than regular web apps.
